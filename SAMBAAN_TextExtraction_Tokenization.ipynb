A union founded, \\\\nlike the United Nations, on peaceful cooperation, human rights and fundamental \\\\nfreedoms. We are therefore an unwavering supporter of the United Nations. And of \\\\nthe international organisations to which we join forces for human progress.\\\\nThis is precisely how we are working with the WHO to defeat COVID-19. Like \\\\nthe whole world, Europe has been hard hit by the pandemic. In the European Union, \\\\nmore than 142,000 people have lost their lives. I salute their memory, and all the \\\\nCOVID-19 victims worldwide. I also pay tribute to all the healthcare professionals \\\\nthat have safeguarded the fabric of our societies.\\\\nThe crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented. It has exacerbated the \\\\nweaknesses of fragile countries, regions and populations. It has also revealed the \\\\nfragility of countries that thought they were strong. It has thrown us all into the same \\\\nsudden battle, against the same common enemy.\\\\nThe European Union, for its part, has been at the forefront of international \\\\ncooperation which has raised nearly €16 billion to finance the research and the \\\\ndeployment of vaccines, tests and treatments. And we are mobilized, alongside all \\\\nthe players involved, to ensure that these vaccines and treatments are universally \\\\naccessible and affordable.\\\\nEach nation and each leader has the duty to reflect on the best way to contribute \\\\nto our common objective. This is true in the fight against the current crisis, as in all \\\\nglobal challenges. Kofi Annan said: “To become a good citizen, start in your own \\\\ncommunity!” It is in this vein that I want to explain why the European Union wants to \\\\nbecome stronger and strategically autonomous, alongside an open market. Stronger \\\\nnot only for itself. But also to better contribute to a better world. The crisis has made \\\\nthis goal even more essential. It has awakened a new collective responsibility, to \\\\nbuild back better and greener…\\\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\\\nBefore the crisis, Europe had already embarked on a path of fundamental \\\\ntransformation.  For  example,  by  deciding  to  become  the  first  carbon-neutral \\\\ncontinent by 2050. Or by adopting an ambitious digital agenda, in line with our  \\\\nfundamental values.\\\\nThis pandemic has increased our determination to transform our economies \\\\nand societies tenfold. €540 billion have been mobilized for urgent measures from \\\\nthe outset. Then, in July, the European Council decided to mobilise ambitious and \\\\nunprecedented financial resources: more than €1.8 trillion for the coming years, \\\\n16/80  21-00392', '13/01/2021  A/75/592/Add.6\\\\nincluding €750 billion raised via the issuance of European Union bonds, unprecedented \\\\nin its nature and size. With this historic decision, we have come together, united and \\\\nstrong, to better assume our responsibilities.\\\\nResponsibility begins by seeing things as they are, and not as we would like \\\\nthem to be. In today’s world, the abuse of force, both military and economic, too often \\\\nsupplants argumentation and negotiation. Respect for treaties, a basic principle of \\\\ninternational law, comes to be considered optional even by those who, until recently, \\\\nwere its historical guarantors. All this in the name of partisan interests.\\\\nMore than ever, the European Union is defending the rules-based international \\\\norder  and  cooperation  based  on  universal  values.  The  European  Union  wants \\\\nto be stronger, more autonomous, and firmer, to defend a fairer world. And it is \\\\nin this spirit that we lead the implementation of the Paris Agreements. And that \\\\nwe have already integrated the objectives of the 2030 Agenda into our system of  \\\\neconomic governance.\\\\nWe are now developing these values and this open model with greater awareness \\\\nof our strength, with more realism, and perhaps less naivety. We have faith in the \\\\nvirtues of free and open economies, never in protectionism. But access to our large \\\\nmarket — the second largest economic zone in the world, and the first in terms of \\\\ninternational trade — will no longer be sold off. From now on, we will better enforce \\\\nthe level playing field, in a market open to those who respect its standards. Whether \\\\nthey leave our Union or want to move closer to it.\\\\nThe European Union is also committed to advancing overall tax fairness, in \\\\nparticular in the digital sector. Large-scale activities carried out in this area can no \\\\nlonger escape fair taxation. The European Union is committed, alongside the OECD \\\\nand the G20, to international cooperation to correct this injustice.\\\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\\\nThe European Union is an actor for peace and progress, which wants to \\\\nmobilise its influence and strength to make others more robust as well.\\\\nWe support the six partners of the Western Balkans in their transformation \\\\nand integration. We have reaffirmed their European perspective. And we have just \\\\ndecided to open accession negotiations with two more countries among them: Albania \\\\nand the Republic of North Macedonia.\\\\nThrough the Eastern Partnership, we are developing our relations with six \\\\ncountries in our neighbourhood. Notably with a view to strengthening institutions \\\\nand the rule of law. In Belarus, the last presidential election was falsified. We do \\\\nnot accept the results. And we condemn the violent repression of the opposition and \\\\nof peaceful demonstrations. Repression and intimidation must stop, and all those \\\\nresponsible must be held accountable and sanctioned. We stand with the Belarusian \\\\npeople who must be free, without any external coercion, to choose their own future. \\\\nInclusive national dialogue, with OSCE facilitation, is the only realistic path forward.\\\\nFighting  impunity  also  means  demanding  an  independent  and  credible \\\\ninvestigation  when  the  Russian  opposition  leader  Navalny  is  the  victim  of  an \\\\nassassination attempt with chemical weapons.\\\\n21-00392  17/80', 'A/75/592/Add.6  13/01/2021\\\\nThe European Union is also on the side of the Venezuelan people. That is why \\\\nwe are working with the International Contact Group for a peaceful and negotiated \\\\nsolution that must include free, credible and fair elections.\\\\nThe relationship between Europe and Africa will, I am sure, be the backbone \\\\nof a fairer and stronger world. Together, we represent some 80 nations and 1.7 billion \\\\ncitizens in this Assembly, the vast majority of whom are among the youngest on the \\\\nplanet. Our two continents have never been so interdependent, for better or for worse. \\\\nTo acknowledge this is neither sterile Afro-pessimism nor naive Afro-optimism. It \\\\nis to recognize that this interdependence is also a calling. It is to recognize that a \\\\nstrong Europe needs a strong Africa, and vice versa. The potential is huge. Investing, \\\\ninnovating,  developing  infrastructure,  promoting  education,  supporting  health \\\\nsystems: this is the key to forging a mutually beneficial partnership. Let us get \\\\ninspired by the power of the African concept of Ubuntu: the way of thinking that my \\\\nhumanity is inextricably linked to yours, our destinies are linked, and our individual \\\\nactions succeed only if they make sense for the common good. This principle of \\\\nUbuntu is also the reason for my renewed call to settle the question of debts of the \\\\npoorest countries, in a spirit of solidarity that also takes into account the effects of \\\\nthe pandemic.\\\\nThe European Union is concerned about tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. \\\\nUnilateral actions and violations of international law must absolutely stop. Together \\\\nwith our Member States, we are undertaking intensive diplomatic efforts to defuse \\\\ntensions and to promote dialogue. In this spirit, I have proposed the organization of a \\\\nmultilateral conference on the Eastern Mediterranean, in conjunction with the United \\\\nNations. Many actors have already responded positively and are ready to discuss the \\\\nmodalities, the agenda and the timetable. Maritime delimitations, security, energy \\\\nissues, and migration are some of the topics that I believe should be addressed.\\\\nWe also support the efforts of the United Nations, and where involved, regional \\\\norganizations, like in Libya or Syria.\\\\nThe Iran Nuclear Deal remains key for global non-proliferation and regional \\\\nsecurity. It is therefore essential to preserve the JCPOA and for all parties to fully \\\\nimplement it. The agreement endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015) \\\\nremains in place and for us there is no doubt that the sanctions lifting commitments \\\\nunder the agreement continue to apply. While we strongly support the preservation \\\\nof the Iran deal, we continue to firmly address other concerns, such as the domestic \\\\nand the regional situation.\\\\nWe also welcome the start of intra-Afghan negotiations and will support a \\\\nlasting peace.\\\\nIn a tormented region, the issue of peace between Palestinians and Israelis is \\\\ntimelier than ever. We must continue to support the legitimate aspirations of both \\\\nparties. And we remain firmly committed to the two-state solution. We will spare no \\\\neffort with our international partners, including the Quartet, to facilitate the return of \\\\nIsraelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table, to find a negotiated solution within \\\\ninternationally agreed parameters. For our commitment to international law and UN \\\\nresolutions is unwavering. At the same time, we welcome Israel’s rapprochement \\\\nwith countries in the region as a positive development for peace and stability in the \\\\nMiddle East.\\\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\\\n18/80  21-00392')\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2) Use the Split function to get the number of words"],"metadata":{"id":"3uiUE-nVq9oo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def remove_punc(textstr):\n","  # remove raw new lines\n","  textstr = textstr.replace(\"\\\\n\", \"\")\n","  # define punctuation\n","  punctuations = '''!()-[]{};:\"\\,<>/?@#$%^-&_0123456789~*'''\n","  # remove punctuation from the string\n","  no_punct = \"\"\n","  for char in textstr:\n","    if char not in punctuations:\n","      no_punct = no_punct + char\n","  return no_punct"],"metadata":{"id":"ztT6QmgTu5wX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["clean_text = remove_punc(textstr)"],"metadata":{"id":"NUxTwe8SvsXg"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(len(clean_text.split()))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fm3dB3QlsTYy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670331217738,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":317,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}},"outputId":"a4e211b5-50e5-4a4e-aaf8-4a17b78b2fae"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1620\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3) Use the Split function to get the number of sentences"],"metadata":{"id":"A1yEWh_IrAuO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(len(clean_text.split(\".\")))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"w3RW2NJNuHto","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670331224411,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":377,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}},"outputId":"7ff5e37c-394a-407d-d6b8-464d1756073f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["106\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 4) Use NLTK framework to get the number of words"],"metadata":{"id":"8TEXeQIWrCs_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# word tokenizer\n","def tokenizeText1(textstr):\n","  word_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(textstr)\n","  return word_tokens"],"metadata":{"id":"Avz0dYTuxsZb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tokenized_word = tokenizeText1(clean_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"8OR_2hPIzhay","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670332376400,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}}},"execution_count":50,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(len(tokenized_word))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5HmfCXrZz0ET","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670332378342,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}},"outputId":"8e8f193e-019f-416a-870c-fd12579146a1"},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1704\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 5) Use NLTK framework to get the number of sentences"],"metadata":{"id":"oj-3wSUprF44"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# sentence tokenizer\n","def tokenizeText2(textstr):\n","  word_tokens = nltk.sent_tokenize(textstr)\n","  return word_tokens"],"metadata":{"id":"yAQSQlvzWeoN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tokenized_sent = tokenizeText2(clean_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"GJ5GGfMFWlU1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670332400575,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":277,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}}},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(len(tokenized_sent))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ug1wc_YvWzvP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670332402169,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":284,"user":{"displayName":"Jezzrel Aladdin Sambaan","userId":"03374997681882509460"}},"outputId":"26ae2eba-f841-4d61-f23c-7a2ff8f65803"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["81\n"]}]}]}
