We have paid not only in human lives, but also in a deepened \\nsocial inequality.\\nThat was a colossal wake-up call for multilateralism. No country can tackle \\nthe pandemic and overcome the profound economic and social impact alone. Our \\nfight against COVID-19 requires better international cooperation and solidarity. \\nMultilateral institutions are crucial to our peace, security and well-being.\\nAs I offer condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones, I reiterate \\nLithuania’s commitment to help others. My country has already assisted the countries \\nmost affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Africa, Central and East Asia, Europe \\nand the Middle East. We will continue to do so in the nearest future!\\nMr. President,\\nAt the time when global insecurity is rapidly growing, peace should remain \\nour top priority. We must show respect to the international law, effectively protect \\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and promote economic and social cohesion \\non a global scale.\\nWithout security there can be no better future for all. My country, Lithuania, \\nknows this perfectly well. Together with two other Baltic States we have experienced \\nthe worst terrors of the 20th century. The end of the Second World War did not bring \\nus freedom. The very moment one totalitarian regime fell, it was replaced by another \\n— all three Baltic States were forcefully annexed by the Soviet Union.\\nThis experience helped to create our special relationship with the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations. We have learned to cherish and respect the fundamental principles of \\nthe international order. We learned to dream about freedom, democracy, the rule of \\nlaw, human rights, the rules-based international order, and multilateral cooperation. \\nThis is what we value up to this day. This is who we are. This is what we offer to \\nthe world.\\nThe century-old mistakes must not be repeated. Our security and stability \\ndepend on a proper assessment of the troublesome past. We must defend objective \\nhistorical narratives that are increasingly under attack by the revisionist forces. \\n21-00387  51/81'"

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News\\n\\n\\nThe following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.\\nDelta variant increases risks for pregnant women\\nCompared to coronavirus cases earlier in the pandemic, infections with the Delta variant lead to worse outcomes for unvaccinated pregnant women, new data suggest.\\xa0\\nDoctors studied 1,515 pregnant women with COVID-19 who received care from a large public health system in Dallas from May 2020 through Sept. 4, 2021.\\xa0\\nOverall, 82 women - 81 of whom were unvaccinated - developed severe illness, including 10 who needed ventilators and two who died.\\xa0\\nThe proportion of severe or critical cases among pregnant women was around 5 percent until early 2021, and were \"largely nonexistent\" in February and most of March 2021, the researchers said in a statement.\\xa0\\n\\nCOVID SCIENCE: Vaccinated pregnant women pass protective antibodies to babies\\n\\nIn late summer, during the peak of the surge of the Delta variant, the proportion of pregnant COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization jumped to 10 percent to 15 percent, they reported in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\\xa0\\nPregnant women face greater risks for complications with any type of severe respiratory infection, so these findings of the higher risk from the Delta variant further emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated for COVID-19, study leader Dr. Emily Adhikari of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center said in a statement.\\xa0\\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for \"urgent action\" to increase COVID-19 vaccination among people who are pregnant, recently pregnant, including those who are breastfeeding, or who might become pregnant in the future, saying \"the benefits of vaccination outweigh known or potential risks.\"\\n\\nPfizer/BioNTech vaccine antibodies disappear in many by 7 months\\nSix months after receiving the second dose of the two-shot vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, many recipients no longer have vaccine-induced antibodies that can immediately neutralize worrisome variants of the coronavirus, a new study suggests.\\nResearchers analyzed blood samples from 46 healthy, mostly young or middle-aged adults after receipt of the two doses and again six months after the second dose.\\xa0\\n\\nPfizer, Moderna effectiveness dropped amid Delta, study says, but jabs still a must to fight COVID\\n\\n\"Our study shows vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original vaccine strain, but these levels drop by nearly 10-fold by seven months\" after the initial dose, Bali Pulendran of Stanford University and Mehul Suthar of Emory University said by email.\\xa0\\nIn roughly half of all subjects, neutralizing antibodies that can block infection against coronavirus variants such as Delta, Beta, and Mu were undetectable at six months after the second dose, their team reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.\\xa0\\nNeutralizing antibodies are not the immune system\\'s only defense against the virus. Still, they \"are critically important in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" said Pulendran and Suthar.\\xa0\\n\"These findings suggest that administering a booster dose at around 6 to 7 months following the initial immunization will likely enhance protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.\"\\n\\nWatch more on iWantTFC\\nExperimental Merck pill halves hospitalizations, deaths\\nMerck & Co\\'s experimental oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir, reduced by around 50 percent the chance of hospitalization or death for patients with mild or moderate infections who had risk factors for severe disease, according to interim clinical trial results announced by the company on Friday.\\xa0\\nA planned interim analysis of 775 patients in Merck\\'s study found that 7.3 percent of those given molnupiravir twice a day for five days were either hospitalized or had died by 29 days after treatment, compared with 14.1 percent of placebo patients.\\xa0\\n\\nMerck to seek US nod for oral COVID-19 drug\\n\\nThere were no deaths among those given molnupiravir but eight in the placebo group. Due to the positive results, the Phase III trial is being stopped early at the recommendation of outside monitors.\\xa0\\n\"An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game changing,\" said Amesh Adalja, from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who was not involved in the study. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible, and to submit applications to regulatory agencies worldwide.\\xa0\\nIf authorized, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\nViber\\n\\n\\n\\nANC, COVID, COVID-19, coronavirus\\r\\n\\nRead More:\\xa0\\nPfizer\\xa0\\xa0\\nPfizer COVID-19 vaccine\\xa0\\xa0\\nDelta variant\\xa0\\xa0\\npregnant women\\xa0\\xa0\\nMerck COVID-19 drug\\xa0\\xa0\\nCOVID-19\\xa0\\xa0\\nCOVID-19 vaccine efficacy\\xa0\\xa0\\n/overseas/10/03/21/taiwan-says-39-china-military-planes-entered-its-air-space-saturday/business/10/03/21/opec-meets-on-output-increase-as-oil-prices-rally/sports/10/03/21/choco-mucho-battles-supreme-chonburi-in-avc-club-qfinals/news/10/03/21/ph-sees-over-13k-new-covid-cases-over-45k-recoveries/overseas/10/03/21/hong-kong-trade-union-disbands-as-impact-of-security-law-deepens \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\nMOST READ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaiwan says 39 China military planes entered its air space Saturday\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nOPEC meets on output increase as oil prices rally\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nChoco Mucho battles Supreme Chonburi in AVC club q\\'finals\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nPH sees over 13k new COVID cases, over 45k recoveries\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nHong Kong trade union disbands as impact of security law deepens\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\n5 things to know about Sara Duterte\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nMga kilalang Pinoy iginuhit na sinliit ng 25 sentimos\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nBicol artist nagbebenta ng mugs para sa heart procedure\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nPilipinas lumahok sa Dubai Expo\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nMga grupo bubusisiin ang plataporma ng mga kakandidato\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nMarami sa mga tatakbo sa lokal na posisyon, magkakapamilya\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\n\\'Maling prayoridad\\' sa panukalang 2022 budget pinuna\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nPBA: TNT fends off San Miguel for 1-0 lead in semis\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nThis Day in PBA History: Codiñera sets blocks record\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nMobile Legends: Onic end Blacklist\\'s 11-game win streak in MPL\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nSome 3,000 pedophiles in French Church since 1950: probe\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nPagbubukas ng Dubai EXPO 2020 pinamangha ang mundo\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nBilang ng COVID-19 patients sa PGH nabawasan na\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nHalalan 2022: Mga naghain ng kandidatura, Oktubre 3\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n\\nPanahon para magpasya si VP Leni mahaba na: analyst\\nOctober 03, 2021\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2021 ABS-CBN Corporation.
